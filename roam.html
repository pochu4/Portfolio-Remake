                        <p class="pp-body">Many hikers struggle with inconsistent trail information, connectivity
                            issues, and difficulty in selecting suitable trails. While existing hiking apps provide
                            extensive trail data, users were often faced with conflicting information for trail details,
                            outdated conditions, and an overwhelmbing amount of information that isn’t easily
                            digestible. The challenge was to create a visually clear experience that allows for users to
                            confidently navigate through the pages and choose trails based on accurate information.</p>
                        <p class="pp-header pp-spacer">SOLUTION</p>
                        <p class="pp-body">To better understand the challenges faced by users on current hiking apps, I
                            applied an empathetic approach to my design process. Through a short competitive analysis,
                            user research methods/exercises and usability testing, I was able to identify key friction
                            points and designed a solution that focuses on creating a seamless trail search experience,
                            simplified card system for quick access to key trail details, and an offline friendly
                            experience to address the access of information in remote areas.</p>

                            an eye out for pain points, and user frustrations. An important insight from a Reddit
                            community discussion highlighted the discrepancy of data between apps, which brings out a
                            major trust issue that needed to be addressed.</p>

                        captures their main goals, pain points, and behaviours. This helped me to identify some key
                        emotional triggers and challenges, allowing me to design a solution that resonates with their

                            user - from sign-up to discovery, navigation and tracking progress. This exercise ensured
                            that the main interaction points for the app were covered and taken into account to remove
                            any obstacles that the users may face. It also creates clear routes and decision points to
                            help me create a more user-friendly app.</p>

                        <p class="pp-body">Beginning with low-fidelity wireframes, I was able to map out the overall
                            layout and structure for ROAM. The initial screens developed had a strong emphasis towards
                            key interactions within the app, follows the user flowchart, and ensures that the primary
                            functions for trail searching, navigation, and filtering were displayed. This stage allowed
                            for a quick usability test to uncover issues early in the process before moving into
                            hi-fidelity designs.</p>

                        <p class="pp-body">Before creating high fidelity designs, I explored various mobile apps and
                            designs that showcased clear and meaningful data, intuitive icons, and thoughtful usages of
                            colour. Feedback from the low-fidelity stages revealed that there was a clear need for a
                            more robust filtering system, leading to the production of a pop-up menu with detailed
                            options and selections such as difficulty, length, elevation gain, and duration in the hi-fi
                            stages.</p>

                        <p class="pp-body">Transitioning into the hi-fidelity stages, I realized that visual appeal
                            plays a large role when hikers make decisions which leads to a potentially cluttered visual
                            design and an overload of images. Therefore, I opted for a dark theme with several
                            background overlays underneath crucial interactive elements to avoid confusions, reducing
                            the cognitive load and assure that users navigate throughout the app seamlessly.</p>

                        <p class="pp-body">Looking forward, there’s tons of room for improvement that I would’ve liked
                            to incorporate into the project. By setting a proper branding/design system for colors and
                            typography in Figma early in the process would’ve allowed me to work more efficient and
                            create better consistency all around the pages.</p>

                    <p class="pp-body pp-margin-none">As this project was done under a short timeframe, all the
                        components were custom made, which is quite unrealistic. For my future projects, I would hope to
                        create a more consistent digital experience that uses an existing UI kit like Google’s Material
                        Design or Carbon IBM’s design system to get a better feel for working with existing components.
                        This would allow me to learn how to use an organized set of components and existing principles
                        that I could apply to my projects, instead of having to create from scratch.</p>
                    <p class="pp-body">Overall, ROAM has been a rewarding learning experience that not only enhances the
                        trail discovery for outdoor enthusiasts, but also helps to motivate individuals to get outdoors
                        and enjoy the physical and mental health benefits that hiking has to offer.</p>
